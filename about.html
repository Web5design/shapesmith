      <p>I'm building Shapesmith to be a free and open source 3D
	modelling project. My aim is to make designing advanced 3D printable
	models accessible to anyone with a modern browser (that
	supports WebGL).</p>
      
      <p>The best places to keep up to date with recent changes is the <a href="/blog.html">blog</a>, and the twitter account for this project, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shapesmith">@shapesmith</a>.</p>
      
      <p>There are two mailing lists:
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="mailto:shapesmith-user@googlegroups.com">shapesmith-user@googlegroups.com</a>
	    for user questions, suggestions, bug reports etc.</li>
	  <li><a href="mailto:>shapesmith-dev@googlegroups.com">shapesmith-dev@googlegroups.com</a> for developer questions, discussions etc. that are beyond the interest of users.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
	If you would like to contribute, please head over to <a href="https://github.com/bjnortier/shapesmith">the github account</a> when you can submit pull requests and view the bugs and features currently in development.
      </p>
      
      <p>Feedback would be very much appreciated! What would <i>you</i> like to see in Shapesmith?</p>
      
      <p>Make something!</p>
